# Patterns for Graph based Authz in Banking

This paper will define a collection of patterns that can be used to implement a high performance scalable  platform using graph based authorization. 


## Assumptions
  
Multiple complex data sources: separate Customer, Channel, Identity Data Sources

User Delegation of banking entitlements

Dynamic Authorization - Risk Based Signals

Open Banking : external Channel Policy (data sources for in scope product etc)

Quorum based Consensus for Actions.... NTH

Dynamic Authorization - Volatile Data Sources 

High Performance AuthZ

Dynamic Authorization - Ecosystem Signals?

Graph as a Cache - not the master ... guidance etc


## Concepts

When should I use Graph based AuthZ?

Nodes Edges and Policies: Primer?

What is the difference between a policy and a graph query?

## Choosing the Right Graph AuthZ platform
